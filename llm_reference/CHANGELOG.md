# LSTM Pattern Strategy Development Changelog

## Overview
This document tracks the development, debugging, and optimization of the LSTM-based market timing strategy. It provides detailed information about implementation decisions, challenges encountered, and solutions applied.

## Initial Implementation

### Architecture Decisions
1. **File Consolidation**
   - Decision: Consolidated all functionality into `lstm_pattern_strategy.py`
   - Rationale: 
     - Easier dependency management
     - Simplified debugging and tracing
     - Reduced import complexity
     - Better code organization for the ML pipeline

2. **Class Structure**
   - Created two main classes:
     - `AttentionLSTM`: Neural network architecture
     - `EnhancedLSTMStrategy`: Strategy implementation
   - Rationale for separation:
     - Clear separation of model and strategy logic
     - Easier testing and maintenance
     - Modular design for future enhancements

### Model Architecture

1. **LSTM Configuration**
   - Hidden Size: 128 (chosen to balance complexity and training speed)
   - Num Layers: 2 (deep enough for pattern recognition, not too deep to avoid vanishing gradients)
   - Dropout: 0.2 (prevents overfitting while maintaining important features)
   - Attention Heads: 4 (allows model to focus on different temporal patterns)
   - Sequence Length: 20 (captures medium-term market patterns)

2. **Attention Mechanism**
   - Implemented multi-head self-attention
   - Added skip connections for better gradient flow
   - Rationale:
     - Helps model focus on relevant time periods
     - Improves handling of long-term dependencies
     - Reduces vanishing gradient problems

## Debugging Journey

### Phase 1: Multiprocessing Issues

1. **Pickling Error**
   ```
   AttributeError: Can't pickle local object 'EnhancedLSTMStrategy.add_technical_features.<locals>.process_column'
   ```
   - Root Cause: Inner function not picklable
   - Solution: 
     - Moved technical feature processing to module level
     - Implemented proper function scope separation
   - Impact: Enabled parallel processing of technical indicators

### Phase 2: Numerical Stability

1. **NaN Loss Values**
   - Symptoms: 
     - Training loss = NaN
     - Model not learning
   - Root Cause:
     - Unbounded feature values
     - Improper handling of infinite values
   - Solutions:
     - Added value clipping: `np.clip(X, -10, 10)`
     - Improved NaN handling in feature calculation
     - Implemented proper data scaling

2. **Infinite Values in Features**
   ```
   ValueError: Input X contains infinity or a value too large for dtype('float64')
   ```
   - Solutions:
     - Added explicit infinite value handling
     - Implemented forward-fill for NaN values
     - Added validation checks for feature calculations

   - Standardization of features
   - Proper train/test split with time series consideration

3. **Feature Engineering**
