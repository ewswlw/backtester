## Version History

### Comprehensive Error Analysis (2025-01-20 16:56:55 EST)

##### 1. Data Loading and Path Issues
1. FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'data/cad_oas_monthly.csv'
   - Initial Assumption: Data file located in 'data/' directory
   - Root Cause Analysis: 
     * Project structure changed, data moved to pulling_data/
     * Path was hardcoded without considering project structure
   - Resolution:
     * Updated path to 'pulling_data/backtest_data.csv'
     * Added logging for data loading steps
     * Future Prevention: Consider making data path configurable
